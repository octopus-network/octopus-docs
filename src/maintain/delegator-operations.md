### Increase/Decrease delegation

### Redelegate

The delegator can change to another validator on the same Appchain without the waiting period via the redelegate operation.

### Unbond delegation

Click the `Unbond Delegation` button on the `Validator Profile` page to perform the unbond delegation operation.

> **Note**: After unbond, the staking OCT will have an unbonding period. Before the unbonding period ends, it cannot be withdrawable and you will not obtain any staking rewards.
