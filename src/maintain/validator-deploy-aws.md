## Automatic deployment with AWS

> If no AWS account, please firstly [create and setup AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/guides/setup-environment/?nc1=h_ls)
>
> To create [AWS Access Key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html)

Log in to the Octopus Network [mainnet](https://mainnet.oct.network) with the NEAR account created in [Generate Validator Account](./validator-generate-keys.md).

![validator login](../images/maintain/validator_login.jpg)

Click the `Appchains` and select the appchain which would like to be a validator, click it to open the appchain page, then perform the following operations:

1. In the **My Node** area of ​​the appchain page, select `AWS` and input your `AWS Access Key` in the `Access Key` input box, then click `Next`;

2. The deployed AWS instance configuration information and approximate cost will be displayed in the **My Node** region. After confirmation, please input your `AWS Secret Key` in `Secret Key` input box and select the deployment area of the AWS instance in the `Deploy region` drop-down box, then click `Confirm`;

**Note**: The AWS Secret Key will only be used for this deployment and will not be stored anywhere.

3. In the **My Node** area, the node status is `Applying` which means the automatic deployment service is deploying the node.

Please wait for about 3~5 minutes, the node status will change to `Syncing` which means the validator node is synchronizing the block data of the appchain. The earlier the appchain is online, the longer the node synchronization time will be. please wait patiently.

To check the synchronization of nodes, please refer to [Monitor Node](./monitor-node.md).

After the node synchronization, the status in the **My Node** area will change to `Running`.

![validator running](../images/maintain/validator_aws_running.jpg)

For the automatically deployed validator node, in the **My Node** area, the validator can click the icon on the right of the `Instance Status` field to check the instance status information (such as CPU, hard disk, memory) of the running validator node instance.

At the `Running` status, the validator can proceed to the next step [register validator](./validator-register.md).

### Change AWS instance type

The validator can resize the AWS instance by changing the instance type as the appchain requirement change. Click the link to the right of `Instance` in the **My Node** region to open the console of the automatically deployed AWS EC2 instance, then, please refer to AWS EC2 [Changing the Instance Type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-resize.html) to complete the operation.
