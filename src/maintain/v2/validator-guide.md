## Validator Guide

To be a validator of appchain in the Octopus network, you need to complete the following steps:

1. [Register Validator](./validator-register.md)
2. [Deploy Appchain Node](./validator-deploy.md)
3. [Bond Validator](./validator-operations.md), you don't need to do this step, if you use the automatic deployment service and complete the bond operation step.
