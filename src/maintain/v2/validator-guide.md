## Validator Guide

> **Note**
>
> Before running a validator node, make sure you can handle node issues and exceptions. If there is a problem with the node, both the validator and its delegators will not be able to receive staking rewards.

To run a validator node of appchain in the Octopus network, you need to complete the following steps:

1. [Generate Validator Account](./validator-generate-keys.md)
2. [Deploy Validator Node](./validator-deploy-manually.md)
3. [Register Validator](./validator-register-manually.md)

If you need help, please go to the **validator-assistance** channel under the **VALIDATORS & DELEGATORS** category on [Discord](https://discord.gg/6GTJBkZA9Q). The team and other validators would answer questions and share experiences.
