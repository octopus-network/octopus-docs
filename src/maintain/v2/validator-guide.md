## Validator Guide

> **Note**
>
> Before running a validator node, make sure you can handle node issues and exceptions. If there is a problem with the node, both the validator and its delegators will not be able to receive staking rewards.

To run a validator node of appchain in the Octopus network, you need to complete the following steps:

1. [Generate Validator Account](./validator-generate-keys.md)
2. [Register Validator](./validator-register.md)
3. [Deploy Validator Node](./validator-deploy.md)
4. [Bond Validator](./validator-operations.md), you don't need to do this step, if you use the automatic deployment service and complete the bond operation step.

**Congratulations!** If you have followed all of these steps, and been selected to be a part of the validator set, you are now running a appchain validator! Welcome to join the validator/delegator Discord channel via clicking the button on each Appchain page.
