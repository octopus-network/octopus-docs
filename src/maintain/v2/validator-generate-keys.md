## Generate Validator Account

Every validator must have:

* A NEAR account, used to log in to the Octopus network, register the validator, etc. To create a NEAR account, please refer to [Creating a NEAR Account](https://docs.near.org/concepts/basics/accounts/creating-accounts)
* A validator pubkey, used to set it to the validator node, etc. You can get a validator pubkey after you initialize the Appchain for your validator node.
