## Octopus Network Infrastructure

Octopus Network provides infrastructure supports for appchains within the ecosystem, including testnet, RPC gateway, indexer, block explorer, cross-chain bridge, and more.

### Testnet

Appchain team can [apply](../guides/appchain-register.md) and launch the testnet to learn the [onboarding process](../guides/appchain-startup.md) and do the functionality testing before the mainnet launch.

### RPC Gateway and Indexer

Appchain team can use RPC gateway and [Indexer](../guides/appchain-indexer.md) to speed up and simplify the development of the front-end applications.

### Block Explorer

The users of the appchain can query the details of the transactions through the block explorer.

### Cross-chain Bridge

The cross-chain bridge of the Octopus Network is a two-direction cross-chain bridge between the appchain and the NEAR network, through which the appchain team can [transfer assets](../guides/mainchain-stablecoin.md) on the two networks. At the same time, before the launch of the mainnet of the appchain, the appchain team can also [transfer some native tokens](../guides/appchain-nativetoken.md) through the cross-chain bridge for the IDO.
