## FAQ

### [1. What is the difference between Octopus Network's NEAR Restaking and NEAR protocol's staking](#1-what-is-the-difference-between-octopus-networks-near-restaking-and-near-protocols-staking)

The core difference is that Restaking will stake NEAR into the Octopus Network's LPoS contract to provide security for Appchain. So the validator and delegator would get the additional restaking rewards.

Also you can refer to the [Restaking](./octopus-restaking.md) for more detail.

### [2. Why didnâ€™t I see the rewards after restaking](#2-why-didnt-i-see-the-rewards-after-restaking)

The distribution cycle of the restaking rewards is 1 day. Also, the validator set is updated at 13:30 UTC+0 every day. So for example: if you complete the restaking at 12:30 UTC+0 on Dec 18th, you should get the rewards after 13:30 UTC+0 on Dec 19th, but if you complete the restaking at 13:35 UTC+0 on Dec 18th, and you will be added to the validator set after 13:30 UTC+0 on Dec 19th, in this case you should get the rewards after 13:30 UTC+0 on Dec 20th.

### [3. Do I need to claim rewards regularly](#3-do-i-need-to-claim-rewards-regularly)

NO. NEAR's staking rewards are automatically restaked. And the restaking rewards need to be claimed by yourself, however, there is no limit of time.
