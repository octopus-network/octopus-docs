## Indexer

The Octopus Network will prepare an indexer for each appchain, which provide GraphQL interface and make frond-end development much more simplified than the RPC. Now each Appchain explorer is based on this indexer service.

How to use the Indexer? Please refer to the [tutorials](https://doc.subquery.network/tutorials_examples/run-indexer/) from the SubQuery.
